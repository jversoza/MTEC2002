Overview
====
This class will cover basic to intermediate programming concepts using Python.  In addition, libraries focused on web development, machine learning, gaming, and other emerging media will be introduced as examples of practical applications.  The semester will be broken down into three main sections:

* __Weeks 1-6:__ Programming Foundations and Introduction to Python
* __Weeks 6-12:__ Python libraries
* __Weeks 12-16:__ Final project / Data Structures and Algorithms

More specifically, this class will help you:
* Understand essential concepts behind programming and software development 
* Comprehend and modify other people's code
* Pick up other programming languages and spot similar constructs
* Build Python programs

Structure
====
Each class will consist of the following
* Discussion of last week's homework
* Lecture
* In-class labs 
* Close and summary

Course Work
====
The labs for each week will be purposely ambitious.  Leftover material will be for take-home assignments.  Consequently, there will be weekly homework.  The only way to learn how to program is to actually program.   **A lot**.  Roughly, the homework will consist of: 
* Readings 
* Left over lab work and short programming exercises	
	* Writing your own code
	* Reading and modifying other people's code (including your peers)
	* Will be executed using unit tests
	* Will be run through pylint

Homework policies:
* To be turned in **electronically via github**
* No later than the beginning of the following class (that is, the following Wednesay at 6:00 PM)

Quizzes:
* 4 x quizzes
* Questions will be **very basic** (if you've done the homework, there's no need to prep!)

There will also be two major projects that you are expected to work on outside of class: 
* Midterm
* Final

Attendance
====
Attendance is required for all classes. If a student misses a class session, it is the student's responsibility to make up any work missed. More than 3 absences will result in an "F" (Failure). Two late arrivals = one absence.

Grading
====
* 5% - participation (in class, and electronically!)
* 10% - quizzes
* 50% - labwork/homework
* 10% - midterm
* 25% - final project

Lab Policy
====
1. No food or beverages at any time.
2. Do not modify desktop settings and do not leave any files on the desktop.
3. Locate all of your work in the assigned student folder.
4. No installation of software unless working with an instructor.
5. You are responsible for keeping all of your files on portable storage media. We cannot promise your files will remain from one class to the next.
6. Lab is reserved for students enrolled in MTEC or ENT courses.
7. Open lab hours are posted and subject to change.
