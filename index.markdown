Overview
====
This class will cover basic to intermediate programming concepts using Python.  In addition, libraries focused on web development, machine learning, gaming, and other emerging media will be introduced as examples of practical applications.  The semester will be broken down into three main sections:

* Weeks 1-6: Programming Foundations and Introduction to Python
* Weeks 6-12: Python libraries
* Weeks 12-16: Final project / Data Structures and Algorithms

More specifically, this class will help you:
* Understand essential concepts behind programming and software development 
* Comprehend and modify other people's code
* Pick up other programming languages and spot similar constructs
* Build Python programs

Structure
====
Each class will consist of the following
* Discussion of last week's homework
* Lecture
* In-class labs 
* Close and summary

There will be weekly homework.  The only way to learn how to program is to actually program.   **A lot**.  Roughly, the homework will consist of: 
* Readings 
* Programming exercises - to be turned in **electronically via github**
	* Writing your own code
	* Reading and modifying other people's code (including your peers)
	* Will be executed using unit tests
	* Will be run through pylint

Quizzes:
* 4 x 10 minute quizzes
* Questions will be **very basic** (if you've done the homework, there's no need to prep!)

There will also be two major projects.  You can work as individuals or as teams.  However, if you work as  a teams, collaboration must be apparent via commits in git.
* Midterm
* Final
