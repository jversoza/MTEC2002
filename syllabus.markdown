	* LPTHW, Exercise 28: [Boolean Practice](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex28.html)
		* Read the exercise and do the activities - solve each equality test and type it out in a file.  Test your answers using the interactive Python shell. 
		* Paste your answers __and__ your session from your interactive shell as comments in the file.  See this [example](class1/hw/lpthw_ex28.py

###Labs
For this lab, create a directory called mtec2002_class2, and place all you Python source files (.py) and text files (.txt) there.  Zip up the folder and email it to me.

__Part 1__ - Review
* [Guess a number](class2/labs/guess_number.txt)
* For every code change submit a new file with the suffix of the exercise number (ex. guess_number_1.py, guess_number_2b.py)

__Part 2__ - Functions
* [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Chapter 3 - Functions](http://www.openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english2e/ch03.html)
* Read the entire chapter, including the definitions
* Follow along in the interactive shell
* Create a file called thinkcs_chap_03.txt.  Use it for the activities in this chapter (see below)
* Section 3.1 - Definitions and use
	* create tryme1.py
	* try running it
* Section 3.3 - Parameters, arguments, and the import statement
	* paste activities from interactive shell into thinkcs_chap_03.txt 
	* put them under a heading called "==3.3=="
	* create chap03.py and try running it
* Section 3.4 - Composition
	* paste activities from interactive shell into thinkcs_chap_03.txt 
	* put them under a heading called "==3.4=="
* Section 3.5 - Variables and parameters are local
	* paste activities from interactive shell into thinkcs_chap_03.txt

	* tryme2.py
	* try running it
* Section 3.8 - Exercises
	1. create tryme3.py
	2. create a new version of tryme3.py called tryme3_2.py.  Answer the quetion and paste it into thinkcs_chap_03.txt under a heading called "==3.8 - 2=="
	3. create a new version of tryme3.py called tryme3_3.py.  Answer the question and paste it into thinkcs_chap_03.txt under a heading called "==3.8 - 3=="
	4. create import_test.py and paste the output from you interactive shell session in thinkcs_chap_03.txt under a heading called "==3.8 - 4=="
* EXTRA CREDIT: Wrap the code in your last version of guess_number.py in a function that accepts two parameters: secret_number and close_by.  Try importing the file in the interactive shell... and call your function.  Save your new file  as guess_number_function.py and the results of your interactive session.

__Part 3__ - Lists, Sequences
