=====
markdown is a module that allows you to compile markdown code into html.  Markdown syntax is much more simple than html, and it is commonly used as a way of formatting text input where actual html is too cumbersome to deal with.  Read the documentation to learn how to use the markdown module: http://packages.python.org/Markdown/reference.html#the-basics

Prep:
1.  Install the markdown module: pip install markdown
2.  Check out the documentation: http://packages.python.org/Markdown/reference.html#the-basics

Code:
1.  Bring in the markdown module 
2.  Create a multi-line string with the following contents:
* this is a list
* of strings!
3.  This string represents a markdown list.  Convert the markdown list into html by calling the function specified in the documentation (http://packages.python.org/Markdown/reference.html#the-basics)

Expected Output:
<ul>
<li>this is a list</li>
<li>of strings!</li>
</ul>
