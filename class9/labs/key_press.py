===
Use the docs to handle a keyboard event:
http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/event.html
http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/key.html

When the user presses the spacebar, place the circle at a random position.
1. Create two variables, x and y... and initialize to where you want the circle to start
2. In the for event loop... check for: 
		elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN and event.key == pygame.K_SPACE:
3. If that occurs, then change the value of x and y to random values
