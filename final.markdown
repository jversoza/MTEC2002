Final Project
===
Create a Python program that uses the constructs, libraries and concepts that we've covered throughout the semester.

Due Dates
===
Proposal due on __May 9th__

Proposal Short Presentation on __May 9th__

Check-in Presentation on __May 16th__

Final Project due on __May 23rd__

Final Project Presentation on __May 23rd__

Overview
===

__Create a Python program.  The project should:__
* Use a module (either built-in modules, such as turtle or SocketServer, or external libraries, such as PyGame or Django)
* Use at least one feature, function, method or class of the module that we did not cover in class
* Demonstrate your ability to use at least three of the following constructs:
	* loops
	* conditionals
	* exception handling
	* classes
	* functions/methods
* Demonstrate your ability to use list, dictionaries and/or tuples

__Some examples of projects may include:__
* Create pong game in PyGame
* Create a todo list web application using Django or other Python web framework
* Create an interactive Blender scene 
* Communication between Python and another technology (Arduino, Processing) through serial or SocketServer
* An animation using turtle
* A soundscape or composition using Python digital audio processing

__There will be three milestones for this project:__
1. Proposal
2. Check-in
3. Final project 

For each milestone, code and/or project materials must be submitted via github.  In addition, a short, in-class presentation, will be expected for each milestone.  During the check-in and final presentation, there will be group code reviews as well as recommendations/critiques.

May 9th - Proposal
