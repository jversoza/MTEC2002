=====
1.  Write a function that takes a list of strings.  It returns only the strings that are three letters long.

Example Output:

>>> only_three(["Alice", "Bob", "Eve"])
['Bob', 'Eve']

	a. Test your function (use a list with no 3 letter words and a list with some 3 letter words).  Paste the output of your interactive shell session here.
	===

	b. EXTRA CREDIT: There's already a function that filters lists.  Look it up and try using it.  Hint: it takes a function as an argument!
