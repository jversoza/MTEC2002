=====
1.  Write a function, last_in_line, that takes two arguments: a comma delimited string and an int.  The function will return the comma delimited string with the character in the nth place moved to the end of the string.  You should be able to import the file in your Python interactive shell session.  Here's what you should see:

>>> from str_list import *
>>> last_in_line("1,2,3,4,5", 1)
'2,3,4,5,1'
>>> last_in_line("1,2,3,4,5", 2)
'1,3,4,5,2'
>>> last_in_line("1,2,3,4,5", 5)
'1,2,3,4,5'

	a. Test your program with 3 values (try an index that would move the 1st number, last number, and a number in between) in a Python interactive shell; paste the output below:

	b. Try running your program with an int that is higher than the length of numbers in your string.  What happens?  If there's an error, paste it below... then try fixing your program.
