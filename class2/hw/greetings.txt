=====
1.  Write a function that contains a list of names.  The function will ask the user for a greeting.  The program will then print out each name with the greeting before the name.

Partial implementation:
def hi(greeting):
	names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Eve"]
	#
	#
	#

Example output:
>>> hi("hello")
hello Alice
hello Bob
hello Eve

	a.  EXTRA CREDIT: Try limiting the greeting to only "Hi or Hello"
