1. Read http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding#Example
2. Create a function called encode that takes one argument, s
3. Encode the string s using the algorithm above
4. Run the function on the following strings: "tutt", "razzamtazz", "wwwwhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat the what??"

Expected Output:
tutt encoded is 1t1u2t
razzamtazz encoded is 1r1a2z1a1m1t1a2z
wwwwhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat the what?? encoded is 4w7h36a1t1 1t1h1e1 1w1h1a1t2?

5. (OPTIONAL) Try writing a decode function!
