===
1. Create two dictionaries, book1 and book2,  that contain information about a book: title, author, pages
    Dune, Frank Herbert, 500
    Frankenstein, Mary Shelley, 278
2. Iterate through each dictionary and create a list of strings with the key and value in a sentence - ex: title is Dune.
3. Use list comprehensions to do this
4. Print out the resulting lists

Example Output:
['author is Frank Herbert.', 'pages is 500.', 'title is Dune.']
['author is Mary Shelley.', 'pages is 278.', 'title is Frankenstein.']
