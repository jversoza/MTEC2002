===
1. Dictionaries are lists of key, value pairs (they're like hashes or associative arrays in other languages)
2. The keys and values are separated by colons, the key, value pairs are separated by commas
3. Dictionaries are enclosed by curly braces
4. An empty dictionary is represented by two curly braces with nothing in the middle - {}
5. The most common type of dictionary key is a string, but any immutable type (such as numerical types and tuples) can be keys too!
6. Dictionary keys are case sensitive
7. Dictionary keys are unique; you can't have duplicate keys
8. Values can be accessed by using the dictionary name followed by the key in square brackets
9. Order of the key, value pairs cannot be guaranteed!

Examples:
superstitious_things = {"lucky_charm":"horseshoe", "number" 7, "spirit_animal":squid}
superstitious_things["number"]

# create an empty dictionary, set it to a variable named empty

# print out the empty dictionary

# create a dictionary that describes a pineapple using the keys name, type, and taste

# print out the dictionary 

# create another dictionary that describes a lemon using the keys name, type, and taste

# print out the dictionary 

# print out the value at key name

# create a new key, color, by  using the new key and assigning it to a variable

# print the value at the new key

# print the dictionary

# create a dictionary of four of your favorite things using the keys color, food, animal, and number

# print out the dictionary

# print out your favorite color

# print out your favorite number

# print out your favorite animal

# print out your favorite animal and color in a sentence

# change your favorite number

# print out your favorite number

# change your favorite animal

# print out your favorite animal

# print out your dictionary

# try printing an item with a key that doesn't exist

# what happened?  comment out your previous line to continue

# you can also use the get method on a dictionary to retrieve an element, but have a default value if the key doesn't exist

# just like a list, you can use the del statement to delete a dictionary item

# print out the dictionary after deleting an element

# get the list of keys in your dictionary using the keys method, set it to a variable named my_keys

# print out the keys

# loop through the keys using a for loop, print out each element

# get the list of values in your dictionary using the values method, set it to a variable named my_values

# print out the values

# loop through the values using a for loop, print out each element

# get all of the key, value pairs of your dictionary as a list of tuples using the items method; set it to a variable called tuples

# print out this list

# loop through the list of tuples using a for loop, print out each tuple
