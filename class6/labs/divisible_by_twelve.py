===
1. Ask the user (print out) for a number that's divisible by 12
2. Prompt the user for input, and store the input in a variable called num
3. Use a while loop to continue to ask the user for input until the user gives a number that's divisible by 12

Hints:
1. Use the modulo operator to determine if num is divisible by twelve
2. Use int to convert the user's input from a string to an int

Example Output:
Give me a number that's divisible by 12
>65
Give me a number that's divisible by 12
>29
Give me a number that's divisible by 12
>144
Thanks! 144 is divisible by 12
