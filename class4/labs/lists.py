# use range to create a list of ints; assign to a variable called list_of_numbers

# create a list of strings with list literals (let's say simpson's characters); assign to a variable called list_of_strings

# create an empty list; assign to a variable called my_list

# find the length of all three of the above lists; print each out

# append an item to every list; print out the new lists

# add every element of one list to another list using extend

# try to find an existing element in one of the lists using index; print out the index

# try to find a non-existing element in one of the lists using index; comment out when you're done

# try to find an existing element in one of the lists using "in", print out the boolean

# remove an element from one of the lists using del

# remove the first occurrence of an element in one of the lists using the "remove" function

# pop off the last element and save it into a variable; print out the variable

# get a new list with only the first 4 elements of the original list using slicing

# sort the new list using sort

# convert the list to a string

# make the string "ow, ouch, ack" into a list
