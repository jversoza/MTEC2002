For Loops - Printing Out All Values...
=====
Prep:
Create a list of ints from 0 to 9 called numbers by using the range function.
Create a list of strings called animals with the words "zebra", "lion", and "giraffe"

1. Using a for loop, print out all of the values in the numbers list

	Example Output:
		0
		1
		2
		3
		4
		5
		6
		7
		8
		9

2. Using a for loop, print out all of the values in the animals list

	Example Output:
		zebra
		lion
		giraffe

3. Using a for loop, print out the lengths of all of the animal names
	
	Example Output:
		5
		4
		7

4. Using a for loop, print out all of the values in the numbers list, but with each number multiplied by 10

	Example Output:
		0
		10
		20
		30
		40
		50
		60
		70
		80
		90

5. Using a for loop, print out all of the values in the animals list in a sentence that says "oh noez, a [ANIMAL NAME]!"

	Example Output:
		oh noez, a zebra!
		oh noez, a lion!
		oh noez, a giraffe!

INTERMEDIATE

6. Add "aardvark" and "eagle"  to the list of animals using append.  Loop through the list of animals again and say "oh noez, a [ANIMAL NAME]!".  However, since we would like to be grammatically correct, use the correct article - "a" or "an".  Use "an" if the name of an animal starts with a vowel.

	Example Output:
		oh noez, a zebra!
		oh noez, a lion!
		oh noez, a giraffe!
		oh noez, an aardvark!
		oh noez, an eagle!
