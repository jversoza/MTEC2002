<h2>For loops</h2>
<ul>	
	<li>For loops iterate over items in a sequence (such as lists or chars in a string)</li>
	<li>Not for arithmetic loop progression (well, maybe with some prodding)</li>
	<li>Starts with keyword <strong>for</strong>, followed by a variable name to represent each element in sequence</li>
	<li>Then... keyword <strong>in</strong>, and finally the sequence followed by a colon</li>
</ul>
{% highlight pycon %}
>>> for i in [-1, 1, 1, 5]:
...  print i + 2
{% endhighlight %}
</section>

<section>
<h2>Almost like your typical for loop?</h2>
{% highlight pycon %}
>>> for i in range(10):
...  print i
{% endhighlight %}
</section>

<section>
<h2>While loops</h2>
<ul>	
	<li>Will execute body of loop as long as a condition is True</li>
	<li>Starts with keyword <strong>while</strong> which is then followed by a condition and a colon</li>
</ul>
{% highlight pycon %}
>>> i = 0
>>> while i < 10:
...  print i
...  i = i + 1
{% endhighlight %}
