"""
This module contains naive implementations of run length encoding and 
decoding.  These implementations will work for uppercase and lowercase
letter a through z.  The decode function will definitely not work for
numeric characters that are encoded since there are no escape characters
to deal with ambiguity. 

The decode function will let ValueErrors bubble up in case of a malformed
encoding.

>>> encode('tutt')
'1t1u2t'
>>> encode('wwwwhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat')
'4w7h20a1t'
>>> decode(encode('wwwwhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat'))
'wwwwhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat'
>>> decode('1t1u2t')
'tutt'
>>> decode('')
''
>>> decode('a2b')
