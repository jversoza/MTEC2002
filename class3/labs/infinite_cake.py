"""
Infinite Cake
=====
How would you rewrite the original cake.py so that it continually asks you if you want cake unless you say "yes".  Do this without using loops.  Hint: wrap your original program in a function.... if the answer is no, call the function again. 

Example Output (the > denotes user input):

>>> from infinite_cake import *
>>> ask_cake()
want cake?
> no
want cake?
> no
want cake?
> no
