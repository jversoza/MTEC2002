"""
Pluralize
=====
Create a function that naively pluralizes words; it just adds an s!   Write a function called pluralize.  It takes one parameter - a string called word.  The function declaration should be pluralize(word).  It should return the word with an "s" appended to it.

Example Output (after importing into Python interactive shell):

>>> from pluralize import *
>>> pluralize("cake")
'cakes'

Extra Credit #1 - if the word passed in ends in o, pluralize it by adding an "es" instead of just s.

Extra Credit #2 - look up a list of nouns that have the same singular and plural form.  Put a few of those nouns in a Python list.  Use that list to determine if anything needs to be appended to the input word in order to pluralize it.
