<h2>Let's talk about submitting labs and homework</h2>
<ul>
	<li>We're waiting on a version control system to be installed on lab machines</li>
	<li>In the mean time, place your <strong>lab and homework</strong> files in a folder</li>
	<li>Archive and/or compress that folder (use zip or tar/gzip)
	<li>Send me your homework</li>
		<ul>
			<li>To: jversoza@citytech.cuny.edu</li>
			<li>Subject: "MTEC2002 Homework #(homework number)"</li>
			<li>Attach your homework</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Homework is <strong>always</strong> due by the next class</li>
	<li>Late homeworks will receive a score of 0</li>
	<li>Questions - let me know!</li>
</ul>
</section>

<h2>Wait, but what about the previous two labs/homeworks?</h2>
<p>Because of the circumstances, I'm willing to accept resubmissions for homework #1 and #2 next week.</p>
<ul>
	<li>We'll have no homework specific to this week's topics (especially since you have a short quiz next week)</li>
	<li>Use it to catch up on the previous assignments</li>
</ul>
</section>

<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>For coding assignments, each exercise is worth some number of points.  I grade both the lab and the homework together, since they are really just one assignment.  I usually assign the remainder of unfinished labs as homework.</p>
<ul>
	<li>50% of total points submitting code that looks like you've made some effort</li>
	<li>25% of total points for running without syntax errors</li>
	<li>25% point for producing the expected output</li>
	<li>Extra credit will vary from assignment to assignment</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>What that means for you...</h2>
<p>If you focus during the labs, you can get most, if not all, of your homework done!</p>
<p>You can get 75% of all available points by just making an effort that produces no syntax errors!  At that point, I can at least help you produce the proper output.</p>
<p>Lastly, lab/homework assignments count for <strong>50%</strong> of your grade</p>

<section>
<h2>Homework #1 - Discussion</h2>
<p>A few things that I noticed from homework #1:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>RUN YOUR CODE BEFORE SUBMITTING!</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Having difficulty running your code?</li>
			<li>Save to Desktop</li>
			<li>In terminal... cd Desktop, then run python my_file.py</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Clean up syntax errors</li>
	<li>Consistent indentation (only use tabs or only use spaces, <strong>not both</strong>)</li>
</ul>
</section>


<section>
<h2>Recap</h2>
<ul>
	<li>You can resubmit homework #1 and #2 by next week</li>
	<li>Run your code before you submit, make sure you don't have syntax errors</li>
	<li>Keep your indentation consistent</li>
	<li>Turn in your homework on time</li>
	<li>Remember - <strong>labs and homework</strong> are worth 50% of your grade</li>
	<li>Oh yes... the first quiz will be next week.  It will be on variables, numbers, strings and conditionals.</li>
</ul>
