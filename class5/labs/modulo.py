=====
1.  Imagine the modulo operator (%) did not exist.  Re-implement modulo by creating a function called mod.  Mod takes two arguments.  7 % 5 should be equivalent to mod(7,5).  Use a while loop and either subtraction or addition.  After importing into an interactive Python shell session, you should see the following:

>>> mod(7,7)
0
>>> mod(7,5)
2
>>> mod(7,2)
1

	a.  What happens when you put in 0 as the second argument?
