Experiment with the built in turtle module.  The turtle module allows you to work with a "virtual pen plotter".

See http://docs.python.org/release/3.1.3/library/turtle.html

1. The turtle (pen) can be up or down.  When it's down, it draws a line wherever the turtle moves.
2. The center of the window, the origin, is at (0, 0)
3. You will have to tab over to the window that creates your program since it may not have focus when you first run it
4. Terminal will "wait" until you quit the program... so you have to close the window that the program creates to end the program

Some commands that you can use:
1. turtle.up() 			# pick up the turtle (pen), don't draw	
2. turtle.down() 		# put down the turtle (pen), draw
3. turtle.right(90) 	# turn the turtle right 90 degrees
4. turtle.left(180) 	# turn the turtle left 180 degrees
5. turtle.forward(100) 	# move the turtle fowards 100 pixels
6. turtle.goto(0, 0) 	# move hte turtle to the coordinates (0, 0)
7. turtle.mainloop() 	# *always* call this at the end of your program to start the main even loop
"""
	
# use the import statement to bring in the turtle module

# use the import statement to bring in the random module

# move the turtle foward 100 pixels

# turn the turtle 90 degrees to the left

# move the turtle foward by a random number - between 5 and 20 - of pixels 

# pick up the pen

# move the turtle foward by a random number - between 5 and 20 - of pixels 

# put the pen back down

# use a for loop to repeat the previous 4 lines 7 times

# use the goto method to move to the coordinate (-50, -100)

# start the main event loop (see #7)
