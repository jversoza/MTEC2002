<h2>Introductions</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Hi, my name is...</li>
	<li>What's the last language you learned?</li>
	<li>What's the last programming project you worked on?</li>
	<li>Anything in particular about Python that you're interested in learning (libraries, applications, etc.)?</li>
</ul>
<details>
<ul>
	<li>Name, please</li>
	<li>Briefly enamored with statistics, and machine learning - R</li>
	<li>This course description and site was programmed using a templating language</li>
</ul>
</details>

<section>
<h2>A quick survey</h2>
<p>Raise your hand if you...</p>
<ul>
	<li>Took CST1101 or know Processing?</li>
	<li>Heard of version control systems, like git or subversion?</li>
	<li>Are familiar with using the commandline (Terminal, cmd)?</li>
</ul>
<details>
<ul>
	<li>If you took CST1101, then some of this may be easy for you</li>
	<li>We'll be using a version control system called git to keep track of our code</li>
	<li>We'll be using the commandline to get around...</li>
	<li>Don't worry, we'll learn both as we go along</li>
</ul>
</details>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Class goals</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Learn Python!</li>
	<li>Try out some commonly used Python libraries (web development, machine learning, etc)</li>
	<li>Comprehend and modify other peopleâ€™s code</li>
	<li>Learn programming and software development concepts and practices that can be applied to other languages</li>
</ul>
<details>
	<li>We'll adjust the syllabus depending on the rate at which we cover the material</li>
	<li>The priority is going to be the basics</li>
	<li>We can add or remove learning about specific libraries as needed</li>
</details>
</section>

<section>
<h2>This term will consist of three main sections</h2>

</ol>
</section>

<section>

<h2>About Python...</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Python history and language features</li>
	<li>Setting up</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Some Python history</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Yes, it was named after Monty Python</li>
	<li>Based on ABC</li>
	<li>Invented in 1991 by this bearded Dutch guy (Guido van Rossum):</li>
</ul>
<div class="img-container">
	<img src="../img/guido.jpg" />
</div>
<details>
<ul>
	<li>ABC - teaching / prototyping language meant to replace BASIC, Pascal, etc</li>
	<li>Also known as Python's "Benevolent Dictator for Life"</li>
</ul>
</details>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Where it's going (and how it's getting there)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Two active branches of Python: 2.x and 3.x</li>
	<li>Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)</li>
	<li>CPython - reference implementation, but there are others</li>
	<li>The Python Software Foundation (PSF)</li>
</ul>
<details>
<ul>
	<li>3.x meant to remove duplicate features and perceived flaws with prior implementation</li>
	<li>3.x is not backward compatible, but some features have been backported</li>
	<li>PEPs provide structure for evolution and dev of Python; add language features as well as conventions</li>
	<li>(C, Java, C#), and new implementations are maturing (PyPy - Python in Python!)</li>
 	<li>PSF - non-profit organization that provides organizational structure, governance and community building</li>
</ul>

<section>
<h2>About the <em>language</em></h2>
<ul>
	<li>Dynamic / interpreted programming language</li>
	<li>Dynamically typed</li>
	<li>Strongly typed</li>
	<li>Whitespace significant</li>
	<li>Multi-paradigm</li>
	<li>Comprehensive standard library</li>
</ul>
<details>
<ul>
	<li>Technically it's compiled to bytecode, much like Java or c#, but there's no explicit compilation step<li> 
	<li>Dynamically typed - type checks are done at run time rather than compile time, allowing for for types and functionality to be generated at run time... allows duck typing (ex file-like classes in python)<li> 
	<li>Imperetive, object oriented, and to some extent, functional programming</li>
</details>
</section>

<section>
<h2>And all of that means...</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Ease of use</li>
	<li>Easier to Ask Forgiveness than Permission (EAFP)</li>
	<li>One obvious way to do things</li>
	<li>Readability</li>
	<li>Batteries included</li>
</ul>
<details>
<ul>
	<li>Ease of use - no need to wait for compile, no need to declare types, type checking at runtime</li>
	<li>Ease of use - No coercion like PHP or JavaScript</li>
	<li>EAFP - duck typing and exceptions</li>
	<li>Readability - forces proper indentation; whitespace is both human and computer "readable"</li>
	<li>Batteries Included - large standard library</li>
</ul>
</details>

<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>The current 2.x release is 2.7.2, so we'll try to use a veresion as close to that as possible.  This lab has 2.6.1 installed.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Python is installed by default on OSX or Ubuntu </li>
	<li>Windows XP and later: http://www.python.org/download/releases/</li>
</ul>
<details>
<ul>	
	<li>Although Python 3.x is the eventual future of Python, it hasn't been widely adopted in production systems yet, so we're going with 2.x</li>  
	<li>2.7.1 is on Lion and Natty</li>
	<li>Though for most of what we're doing, 2.7.x or 2.6.x should suffice</li>
	<li>For Windows, I've heard that there may be some PYTHON_PATH issues</li>
	<li>For the server (putty on windows, or ssh on OSX, Linux), you may be constrained a bit (no installing packages?)</li>
	<li>The browser based interpreter is really a Python to JS compiler.  Definitely can't install packages.</li>
</ul>
