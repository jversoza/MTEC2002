<h1>Git</h1>
We'll be using a version control system called git.  For this class, we'll primarily use it as a way of uploading files to github (though - github is <strong>distinct</strong> from git).
<h2>At the beginning of each class:</h2>
We'll create a directory where you'll be doing your work.  Then, we'll download the repository for your assignments.  Finally, there are some minor configurations that have to be made - your username and password. 
<ol>
<li>open terminal</li>
<li>change directory to Desktop
{% highlight bash %}
cd Desktop
{% endhighlight %}
</li>
<li>make a directory with your first initial and last name
{% highlight bash %}
mkdir jversoza
{% endhighlight %}
</li>
<li>change directory to the one that you just created
{% highlight bash %}
cd jversoza
{% endhighlight %}
</li>
<li>log into github</li>
<li>get the http URL of your repository</li>
<li> make sure you're in the directory you just created
{% highlight bash %}
pwd
# should return /Users/joe/Desktop/jversoza/
{% endhighlight %}
</li>
<li>download your assignments repository from github using the url that you copied above
{% highlight bash %}
git clone https://your_usrname@github.com/your_username/mtec2002_assignments.git
{% endhighlight %}
</li>
<li> change directory to the repository that you just checked out 
{% highlight bash %}
cd mtech2002_assignments
{% endhighlight %}
</li>
<li>set your username (first initial, last name works)
{% highlight bash %}
# Note that this info is publicly available, so make sure you use a user name you're available
git config user.name "your_username"
{% endhighlight %}
</li>
<li> set your email
{% highlight bash %}
# Note that this info is publicly available, so take care to use an appropriate email address! 
git config user.email "your_email@citytech.cuny.edu"
{% endhighlight %}
</li>
<li>Download the class zip files and extract them into the directory you're in (ex /Users/joe/Desktop/jversoza/mtec2002_assignments) 
</li>
<li> change directory to the one that you just made
{% highlight bash %}
cd class6
{% endhighlight %}
</li>
<li>open that folder in finder</li>
</ol>
<h2>Committing ("Saving") /your Work:</h2>
<ol>
<li>check to see if there's anything to commit or if there's anything staged to be committed
{% highlight bash %}
git status
{% endhighlight %}
you should see files that are not yet "tracked" by git under "Untracked files:"
{% highlight bash %}
# On branch master
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#	class5/
{% endhighlight %}
</li>
<li>Stage your commit by adding files; check the status again
{% highlight bash %}
git add class5
git status
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight bash %}
# On branch master
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
#
#	new file:   class5/lists_loops_review.py
#
{% endhighlight %}
</li>
<li>Commit your work - use a relevant commit message after the "-m"!
{% highlight bash %}
git  commit -m "put in a commit message here"
{% endhighlight %}
You should see something like...
{% highlight bash %}
[master 01f5b6e] added another line to...
{% endhighlight %}
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Sending Your Work to github:</h2>
<ol>push your work to github
<li>
{% highlight bash %}
git push
{% endhighlight %}
You should see something like...
{% highlight bash %}
